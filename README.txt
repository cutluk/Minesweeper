This program is the classic game of minesweeper. It has a couple of extra features like a debug button to show where the mines are (used for development). It is also my first time using SFML in C++. 

In order to run this code, you need to go to https://www.sfml-dev.org/ 
Download the files, then adjust the makefile path to where sfml is stored on your device.
